# **Project: SIM Management using Reflection API and OOP Concepts**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project is a **SIM management system** that utilizes **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** and the **Reflection API** in Java to dynamically load and interact with different SIM card providers (Airtel, Jio, etc.). The system simulates real-world mobile operations such as **recharging, checking balance, making calls, and sending SMS**.  

## **Key Features**  
- **Interface-Based Design**: The `Sim` interface defines common functionalities (recharge, balance check, call, SMS) that different SIM providers implement.  
- **Dynamic SIM Loading (Reflection API)**: The `Mobile` class dynamically loads SIM implementations at runtime based on user input using `Class.forName()` and `newInstance()`.  
- **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: The `Mobile` class acts as an abstraction, interacting with different SIM providers without knowing their internal details.  
- **Interactive User Interface**: `Mobile_Screen.java` provides a console-based menu system for user interaction.  

## **Class Descriptions**  
### **1. Sim.java (Interface)**  
Defines methods that all SIM providers must implement:  
- `recharge(double amt)`: Adds balance to the SIM.  
- `currentBaal()`: Displays current balance.  
- `call(long num)`: Simulates making a call.  
- `sms(long num, String msg)`: Sends an SMS.  

### **2. Airtel.java & Jio.java (SIM Implementations)**  
- Implement `Sim` interface.  
- Define provider-specific behaviors for recharge, balance inquiry, calls, and SMS.  

### **3. Mobile.java (Core Mobile Class)**  
- Uses **Reflection API** to dynamically load a SIM class based on user input.  
- Calls appropriate methods on the inserted SIM.  

### **4. Mobile_Screen.java (User Interaction)**  
- Provides a **menu-driven interface** for users to interact with the mobile system.  
- Allows users to **insert a SIM**, **recharge**, **check balance**, **make calls**, and **send SMS**.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Java** (OOP principles: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Interface Implementation)  
- **Reflection API** (`Class.forName()`, `newInstance()`)  
- **Exception Handling**  

## **Conclusion**  
This project demonstrates **real-world OOP design patterns** and the power of the **Reflection API** in Java by dynamically loading and managing different SIM providers at runtime. ðŸš€
